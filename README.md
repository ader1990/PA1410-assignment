The assignment consists in solving architecture issues given a software system to be designed.
It consists in creating factor tables, issue cards, and relevant strategies for solving the issues. 
The strategies must primarily be software-related and properly referenced. 
All the strategies need to be well motivated in order to create a clear link between the issue itself and how the 
strategy addresses the issue. 
It is also supposed to create a conceptual view of the system, where relevant strategies are implemented, 
with traceability links back to the relevant issue cards.
